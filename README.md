Random question paper generator
##Introduction of the project
  In this system we present a smart question paper generating system for universities. It is made to allow universities to generate question papers with random but even questions to cover most chapters of subject with difficulty level within seconds. In our system we allow the user to input a set of questions and respective answers for option ticking. We also allow the user to provide weight age and complexity for each of these questions. After this the questions are stored in database along with their weight age. Now on question paper generating time the user just has to select the percentage of difficulty. On this selection the system selects questions randomly in a way that their weightage makes up for 100 marks and according to difficulty the user chooses the questions are chosen based on their complexity level. The questions are also added for various difficulty levels so that as soon the user chooses the type of paper difficulty (Easy, medium, difficult) the system automatically generates paper, prepares doc file as per selected paper format.
Features:
•	Question Insertion: User may insert questions as per weight age, difficulty, subject and chapter in the system.
•	Difficulty Choosing: User may then choose the paper difficulty level
•	Random Paper generation: The system now automatically chooses random questions as per the selected difficulty level.
•	Wide Chapter Coverage: The system tries to cover as many chapters as possible for that subject.
•	Doc File Creation: The system now exports the well formatted question paper in a doc file.
